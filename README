Introduction
------------

DFS-Perl is a perl module interface to various aspects of DFS. Currently,
the only interface available is a simple API to manipulate DFS ACLs.
Future releases will include functionality that allows you to get
information about file servers, aggregates, and filesets via perl.

This version of DFS-Perl was released solely because I wanted to
release my aclmod utility, which depends on the ACL API implemented
by this module. There isn't really any documentation for the ACL API,
although it's very simple and easy to use. If you are unable to use
the API without documentation, please wait for the next release, which
will include reasonable documentation as well as additional
functionality.


Installation
------------

Before installing DFS-Perl, you need to have DCE-Perl installed and
configured on your system.

DCE-Perl is available via CPAN, or via the URL:

http://www.osf.org/~dougm/perl/


The lastest version of DCE-Perl available as of this writing is 0.14,
which has a bug in the ACL module. If a new fixed version is not 
yet available, you need to apply the patch in the file
DCE-Perl-0.14.diff by running the following commands before building
and installing DCE-Perl:

     cd /path/to/DCE-Perl-0.14
     patch -p1 -d . < /path/to/DFS-Perl-0.10/DCE-Perl-0.14.diff 


Once DCE-Perl has been successfully installed, you can build and
install DFS-Perl by running the following commands:

     cd /path/to/DFS-Perl-0.10
     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make install


Changes
-------

0.10 - First publicly released version.


Feedback/Availability
---------------------

Please report any bugs or feature requests to <henson@acm.org>.

I'd also be very interested to hear that you're using DFS-Perl. If you
could send me an email describing how you use DCE/DFS at your site, and
what value you receive from DFS-Perl, I'd really appreciate it.
