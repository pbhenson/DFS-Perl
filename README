Introduction
------------

DFS-Perl is a perl module interface that tries to accomplish two things:
first, it provides a simple API to view and modify DFS ACLs, and second, it
provides classes to manipulate DFS internals, such as fileservers,
aggregates, and filesets. Access to DFS state is mostly read-only.
Currently, the only thing DFS-Perl can modify is fileset quota.


Installation
------------

Before installing DFS-Perl, you need to have DCE-Perl installed and
configured on your system.

DCE-Perl is available via CPAN, or via the URL:

http://www.osf.org/~dougm/perl/


The lastest version of DCE-Perl available as of this writing is 0.14,
which has a bug in the ACL module. If a new fixed version is not 
yet available, you need to apply the patch in the file
DCE-Perl-0.14.diff by running the following commands before building
and installing DCE-Perl:

     cd /path/to/DCE-Perl-0.14
     patch -p1 -d . < /path/to/DFS-Perl-0.15/DCE-Perl-0.14.diff 


Once DCE-Perl has been successfully installed, you need to read the file
README.LIBDCEDFS and verify that libdcedfs.a and the necessary header files
are available on your system.


Once these prerequisites are met, you can build and install DFS-Perl by
running the following commands:

     cd /path/to/DFS-Perl-0.15
     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make install


Changes
-------

0.15 - Beta release including new classes to interface to DFS flservers,
       ftservers, aggregates, and filesets.

0.10 - First publicly released version.

I'd also be very interested to hear that you're using DFS-Perl. If you
