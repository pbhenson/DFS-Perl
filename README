Introduction
------------

DFS-Perl is a perl module interface to DFS internals. It includes both a
simple API to manipulate DFS ACLs, and also methods for accessing DFS
servers, such as the flserver and ftserver. Most aspects of DFS-Perl are
read-only; however, DFS-Perl does allow you to change fileset quotas and
create/delete mount points directly from perl.


Installation
------------

Before installing DFS-Perl, you need to have DCE-Perl installed and
configured on your system.

DCE-Perl is available via CPAN, or via the URL:

http://www.intranet.csupomona.edu/~henson/www/projects/DCE-Perl/


The lastest version of DCE-Perl available as of this writing is 0.16.
Earlier versions will not work with this release of DFS-Perl, although
later versions probably will.

Once DCE-Perl has been successfully installed, you need to read the file
README.LIBDCEDFS and verify that libdcedfs.a and the necessary header files
are available on your system.


Once these prerequisites are met, you can build and install DFS-Perl by
running the following commands:

     cd /path/to/DFS-Perl-0.20
     perl Makefile.PL
     make
     make install


Changes
-------

0.20 - Added ability to pass in an open registry handle to ACL bind method.
       Useful when used in account creation scripts when a connection
       to the master registry is needed. If no handle is supplied, the
       default registry handle will be used.

       Added exception handling for DFS RPCs, and fault tolerance for
       flserver calls.

       New methods:

         -- DCE::DFS::crmount(), for creating mount points

         -- DCE::DFS::delmount(), for deleting mount points

         -- DCE::DFS::aggregate::ftserver(), to acquire an ftserver object
            from an aggregate object

         -- DCE::DFS::fileset::ftserver(), to acquire an ftserver object
            from a fileset object

         -- DCE::DFS::fileset::aggregate(), to acquire an aggregate object
            from a fileset object

       Added skeleton of documentation.

       Minor updates to dfs_usage.pl


0.15 - Beta release including new classes to interface to DFS flservers,
       ftservers, aggregates, and filesets.


0.10 - First publicly released version.
